It was founded in 2011 by Ngoc Duong and Olivia Wood who dreamt of a small caf&eacute; that could accommodate both English natives and German locals. Ever since then, their goal is to remind their customers of grandma&rsquo;s cowboy cookies, mom&rsquo;s Scottish shortbread, and uncle&rsquo;s Anzac biscuits or simply warm them up with a cup of their specialty coffee!&nbsp; </span><span>Although Katie&rsquo;s Blue Cat Caf&eacute; uses traditional recipes, they are not afraid of putting a modern spin on their specialties! This is why they dramatically reduce sugar and offer a variety of gluten-free and vegan options. </span></p>","description_provider":"Fernanda","copyright":"© The Trip Boutique","copyright_url":null,"license":"© The Trip Boutique","license_url":"https://www.thetripbotique.co","website":"http://katiesbluecat.de/","phone":"+49 30 62903380","email":null,"latitude":52.4929667,"longitude":13.4282694,"address":"Friedelstraße 31, Berlin","postal_code":"12047","show_on_map":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=11060317863885492678","action_url":null,"action_text":"","virtual_tour_link":null,"virtual_tour_description":"","virtual_tour_booking_button":"","images":[{"id":1724,"author":"Katie\'s Blue Cat","author_url":"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107206928045291707408","license":null,"license_url":null,"order":1731,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/1724/conversions/dd09bbff701c8884807f4dc97f1c0aa0-medium.jpg"},{"id":1725,"author":"Katie\'s Blue Cat","author_url":"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107206928045291707408","license":null,"license_url":null,"order":1732,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/1725/conversions/23d9e426e5e6bfa1665af792375dcb40-medium.jpg"},{"id":1726,"author":"Katie\'s Blue Cat","author_url":"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107206928045291707408","license":null,"license_url":null,"order":1733,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/1726/conversions/7170670454e9af3faed0b1fbe801e396-medium.jpg"},{"id":1727,"author":"Katie\'s Blue Cat","author_url":"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107206928045291707408","license":null,"license_url":null,"order":1734,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/1727/conversions/b8c71d4a73678bc4397609ea7dbe0695-medium.jpg"}],"working_periods":[{"id":353,"seasonal":false,"start_day":null,"start_month":null,"end_day":null,"end_month":null,"year":null,"working_days":[{"day":"Sunday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"09:30","close":"19:00"}]},{"day":"Monday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"08:00","close":"18:00"}]},{"day":"Tuesday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"08:00","close":"18:00"}]},{"day":"Wednesday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"08:00","close":"18:00"}]},{"day":"Thursday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"08:00","close":"18:00"}]},{"day":"Friday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"08:00","close":"18:00"}]},{"day":"Saturday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":"09:30","close":"19:00"}]}]}],"disclaimer":false,"disclaimer_title":null,"disclaimer_description":null,"disclaimer_image":null,"day_part_id":4,"day_order":1,"on_review":false,"requires_replacement":false,"replaced":false},{"id":1125,"parent_category_id":4,"category_id":29,"category":{"id":29,"title":"Café"},"city_id":4,"name":"Café KRONE","price_range":2,"description":"<p>Caf&eacute; Krone is located in Prenzlauer Berg on the Oderberger stra&szlig;e, which is famous for its cute shops, restaurants and caf&eacute;.

Responding to the shortage of accommodation following the destruction of WWII, Le Corbusier decided to redefine social housing in Europe with his project &ldquo;Unit&eacute; d&rsquo;Habitation&rdquo; &ndash; residential units. He first implemented his post-war design in Marseille (1947-1952) and Nantes-Rez&eacute; (1953-1955), before being invited to Berlin by the government for the International Building Exhibition in 1957. The impressive structure, boasting 530 apartments &ndash; most of them two-floored! &ndash; was supposed to stand at the heart of the exhibition in the Hansaviertel quarter. Due to its size, however, the &ldquo;Corbusierhaus&rdquo; had to be built further away from the city center than first planned. Today it is situated on the Olympic hill and overlooks the Grunewald Forest near the Olympic stadium inaugurated in 1936.</p>\\n<p>Since 1995, Unit&eacute; d&rsquo;Habitation, Berlin style, belongs to protected monuments and remains a unique heritage of Le Corbusier&rsquo;s vision of urbanism characterized by grandiose dimensions, egalitarianism, and communal density. The Corbusier building also offers guided tours worth checking out, if you want to learn more about the building&rsquo;s history and explore both its exterior and interior.</p>","description_provider":null,"copyright":null,"copyright_url":null,"license":null,"license_url":null,"website":"http://www.corbusierhaus-berlin.de/","phone":"+49 30 30209833","email":null,"latitude":52.50965,"longitude":13.24381,"address":"Flatowallee 16, Berlin","postal_code":"14055","show_on_map":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=7784467383268382601","action_url":null,"action_text":"","virtual_tour_link":null,"virtual_tour_description":"","virtual_tour_booking_button":"","images":[{"id":428,"author":"","author_url":null,"license":null,"license_url":null,"order":435,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/428/conversions/31-1-d9d50642d58b4cd9645f10174f8ad4917963-medium.jpg"},{"id":429,"author":"","author_url":null,"license":null,"license_url":null,"order":436,"main":false,"path":"https://test.core.trip.boutique/storage/429/conversions/31-3-50c1810a432113e55d449e9af0c08f1e3875-medium.jpg"}],"working_periods":[{"id":26,"seasonal":false,"start_day":null,"start_month":null,"end_day":null,"end_month":null,"year":null,"working_days":[{"day":"Sunday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Monday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Tuesday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Wednesday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Thursday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Friday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]},{"day":"Saturday","full_day":0,"closed":0,"time_periods":[{"open":null,"close":null}]}]}],"disclaimer":false,"disclaimer_title":null,"disclaimer_description":null,"disclaimer_image":null,"day_part_id":4,"day_order":1,"on_review":false,"requires_replacement":false,"replaced":false}]')},"0c66":function(e,t,a){},"199c":function(e,t){},"23be":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=a("199c"),i=a.n(l);t["default"]=i.a},"342f":function(e,t,a){},"3dfd":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=a("970f"),i=a("23be"),o=a("2877"),r=Object(o["a"])(i["default"],l["a"],l["b"],!1,null,"3adec68a",null);t["default"]=r.exports},"470a":function(e,t,a){},"4a87":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"container"},[a("h1",[e._v("Day "+e._s(e.element[1].day_order))])])},i=[],o={props:{element:{type:Object,required:!0}}},r=o,s=(a("4e18"),a("2877")),n=Object(s["a"])(r,l,i,!1,null,"09ebcee6",null);t["a"]=n.exports},"4e18":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=a("b258"),i=a.n(l);i.a},"4ec2":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=a("0c66"),i=a.n(l);i.a},5179:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var l=a("342f"),i=a.n(l);i.a},"56d7":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);a("e260"),a("e6cf"),a("cca6"),a("a79d");var l=a("2b0e"),i=a("3dfd"),o=a("9483");Object(o["a"])("".concat("/Trip/","service-worker.js"),{ready:function(){console.log("App is being served from cache by a service worker.\nFor more details, visit https://goo.gl/AFskqB")},registered:function(){console.log("Service worker has been registered.")},cached:function(){console.log("Content has been cached for offline use.")},updatefound:function(){console.log("New content is downloading.")},updated:function(){console.log("New content is available; please refresh.")},offline:function(){console.log("No internet connection found.
